# ⚠️ NETLIFY DOES NOT SUPPORT FLASK APPLICATIONS ⚠️
#
# Your error: "dependency_installation script returned non-zero exit code: 1"
# This happens because:
# 1. Netlify's build system is designed for Node.js/JavaScript projects
# 2. Your app is Python/Flask, which requires a full Python runtime
# 3. Netlify Functions (serverless) can't handle full Flask apps with:
#    - Multiple routes (/send, /view, /pairing, etc.)
#    - Session management
#    - File uploads
#    - Persistent database connections
#
# ✅ SOLUTION: Use Railway or Render (they support Flask natively)
#
# Railway (Recommended - 2 minutes):
# 1. Go to https://railway.app
# 2. New Project → Deploy from GitHub
# 3. Select your SecApp repo
# 4. Add env vars: MONGO_URI, FLASK_SECRET_KEY, FERNET_KEY
# 5. Done! Railway auto-detects Flask and deploys.
#
# See DEPLOY.md for detailed instructions.

[build]
  # This intentionally fails to prevent wasted build attempts
  command = "echo 'ERROR: Netlify does not support Flask apps. Use Railway instead: https://railway.app' && exit 1"

# If you want to disable Netlify builds entirely, remove this file
# or set build command to: "echo 'Use Railway' && exit 0"
