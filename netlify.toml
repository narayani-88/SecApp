# Netlify configuration
# Note: Netlify works best with static sites and serverless functions
# For Flask apps, consider Railway, Render, or Fly.io instead

[build]
  command = "pip install -r requirements.txt"

# For Flask deployment on Netlify, you'll need to use serverless functions
# Or deploy to: Railway, Render, Fly.io, or Heroku (see Procfile)
